# Instal the Data Interface
Currently, DiTEC-WDN is available for Python >= 3.10. Please setup a virtual environment before installation.

As some libraries are tailored to your OS and CUDA, user should install them separately as follows:

1. Install [PyTorch >= 2.3](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
2. Instal [PyG >= 2.3](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html)

At this time, DiTEC-WDN works best on PyTorch and PyG 2.3.

Afterwards, you can clone DiTEC-WDN or install it via pip:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/DiTEC-project/DiTEC_WDN_dataset.git
```

Tada! DiTEC-WDN data interface has been installed!
