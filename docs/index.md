# DiTEC-WDN Dataset (DWD)

DWD is a collection of synthetic, simulated and steady-state scenarios derived from 36 **Water Distribution Networks (WDNs)**.

Each network has 1,000 distinct hydraulic scenarios generated by an open-sourced simulation toolkit EPANET. 

We then describe surronding concepts as follows:

* **Scenario** denotes as a sequence of snapshots.

* **Snapshot** represents as a network's state often modelled as a graph at a particular timestep.  

* **Nodes** models a reservoir, junction, or tank in the snapshot graph. Each type has same properties and unique ones. 

* **Edges** refers pipe, pump, or valve in the snapshot graph. Each type has same properties and unique ones. 

* **Input parameters** involves in simulation input parameters, such as demands, pipe diameter, and so on.

* **Output parameters** includes simulation measurements (e.g., pressure, flow rate, head, ...)

Both parameters are described as nodal/edge features in the snapshot graph. Their values are diverse but temporally correlated with those of other snapshots in the **same** scenario. 
However, in DWD, any two scenarios are independent and unrelated since they are created from different configurations (despite the same original network).

DWD is designed to:

* Promote open scientific research in the water domain.

* Eliminate risks of exposing sensitive data, privacy issues, or safety concerns.

* Provide a benchmark for data-driven machine learning methods and large-scale scenario analysis.

This wiki details the process of creating DWD, including parameter optimization, simulation, and encapsulation.

It also explains how to use DWDâ€™s data interface, GiDA.

With just two inputs, an .INP file and a YAML configuration, you can generate diverse scenarios and apply this to your own private WDN.
