Each network has 1,000 distinct hydraulic scenarios generated by an open-sourced simulation toolkit EPANET. We then describe surronding concepts as follows: Scenario denotes as a sequence of snapshots. Snapshot represents as a network's state often modelled as a graph at a particular timestep. Nodes models a reservoir, junction, or tank in the snapshot graph. Each type has same properties and unique ones. Edges refers pipe, pump, or valve in the snapshot graph. Each type has same properties and unique ones. Input parameters involves in simulation input parameters, such as demands, pipe diameter, and so on. Output parameters includes simulation measurements (e.g., pressure, flow rate, head, ...) Both parameters are described as nodal/edge features in the snapshot graph. Their values are diverse but temporally correlated with those of other snapshots in the same scenario. However, in DWD, any two scenarios are independent and unrelated since they are created from different configurations (despite the same original network). DWD is designed to: Promote open scientific research in the water domain. Eliminate risks of exposing sensitive data, privacy issues, or safety concerns. Provide a benchmark for data-driven machine learning methods and large-scale scenario analysis. This wiki details the process of creating DWD, including parameter optimization, simulation, and encapsulation. It also explains how to use DWD\u2019s data interface, GiDA.
